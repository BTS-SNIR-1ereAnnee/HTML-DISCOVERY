Page Titles
===========

What kind of metadata about the web page can the `<head>` element contain?

If you navigate to the Codecademy [catalog ](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all)and look at the top of your browser, you'll notice the words `Full Catalog | Codecademy`, which is the *title* of the web page.

A browser's tab displays the title specified in the `<title>` tag. The `<title>` tag is always inside of the `<head>`.
````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>

````

If we were to open a file containing the HTML code in the example above, the browser would display the words `My Coding Journal` in the title bar (or in the tab's title).

# Instructions
