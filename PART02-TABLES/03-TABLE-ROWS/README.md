Table Rows
==========

In many programs that use tables, the table is already predefined for you, meaning that it contains the [rows, columns, and cells that will hold data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)). In HTML, all of these components must be created.

The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the *table row* element: `<tr>`.
````html
<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  </tr>
</table>
````

In the example above, two rows have been added to the table.

# Instructions
